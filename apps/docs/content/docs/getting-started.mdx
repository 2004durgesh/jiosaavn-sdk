title: Getting Started
description: Install, configure, and make your first API call with the JioSaavn SDK.
---

## Installation

```bash tab="npm"
npm install jiosaavn-sdk
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add jiosaavn-sdk
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm add jiosaavn-sdk
```

## Quick Start

Import the service you need and start making calls. No API keys or configuration required.

```ts
import { SongService } from 'jiosaavn-sdk'

const songService = new SongService()

// Fetch a song by ID
const songs = await songService.getSongByIds({ songIds: '3IoDK8qI' })
console.log(songs)
```

## Usage Pattern

Each domain (songs, albums, artists, playlists, search) has its own **Service** class. Instantiate it and call methods:

```ts
import {
  SongService,
  AlbumService,
  ArtistService,
  PlaylistService,
  SearchService
} from 'jiosaavn-sdk'

const songs = new SongService()
const albums = new AlbumService()
const artists = new ArtistService()
const playlists = new PlaylistService()
const search = new SearchService()
```

## Error Handling

All services throw a `SaavnError` when something goes wrong (e.g., resource not found). You can catch and inspect it:

```ts
import { SongService, SaavnError } from 'jiosaavn-sdk'

const songService = new SongService()

try {
  const songs = await songService.getSongByIds({ songIds: 'invalid-id' })
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof SaavnError) {
    console.log(error.statusCode) // 404
    console.log(error.message)    // 'song not found'
  }
}
```

See [Error Handling](/docs/error-handling) for more details.
